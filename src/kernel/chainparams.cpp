// EPOCH-A PROFILE-1 ONE-TIME ASERT POLICY COEFFICIENT — RECONFIRM THE

//
// WHAT THIS NUMBER IS. It is the PRE-GATE NONCE-ATTEMPT-RATE RATIO
//     C = N / M
// where N is the v3 miner's raw nonce attempts per second (sigma is computed
// for EVERY nonce) and M is the Profile-1 RC episode rate per second.
//
// It is NOT the realized difficulty loosen k, NOT the post-gate digest-trial
// rate ratio R_eff/R_rc, and NOT the v3 matmul-only rate R_M. Those are
// different quantities and substituting one for another is not a rounding
// error -- see the hazard note below.
//
// DERIVATION. v3 needs both gates, Profile 1 keeps only the digest gate:
//     lambda_v3 = N * q * p        with q = 2^epsilon * p
//     lambda_rc = M * p_rc
// Continuity (lambda_rc = lambda_v3) gives p_rc = p * q * (N/M), which is
// exactly what DeriveMatMulEpochATransitionTarget computes. The realized
// loosen is the OUTCOME k = p_rc/p = q * C, not an input.
//
// MEASURED, same-silicon, two vendors
// (doc/evidence/asert-two-rig-calibration-2026-08-03):
//     CUDA sm_120 : N/M = 6.93e9  -> k ~ 119'783
//     Metal m4    : N/M = 1.15e9  -> k ~  19'900
// The 5.8x spread is a hardware-mix property. Installed at the CUDA figure
// because the loss function is asymmetric: under-loosening costs linearly in
// the error while over-loosening costs only logarithmically, so biasing toward
// the faster observed miner is the cheap direction.
//
// HAZARD, and the reason this comment is long. An earlier revision of this
// file installed a SATURATED uint32 value and described the field as a
// "throughput ratio", while the calibration evidence recommended installing k.
// Installing k (about 1.2e5) as C would yield a realized loosen of q*k ~ 2.1
// instead of the intended ~1.2e5 -- under-loosening by 1/q ~ 57'864x, which at
// a 90 s target is a first block expected in roughly 60 DAYS. The uint32
// saturation is also gone: the Epoch-A path does exact wide arithmetic and now
// reduces through ReduceRescaleRatioToU64, so the measured value is installed
// directly rather than clipped.
//
// matmul_unified_activation_tests pins a fixed vector at the calibration nBits
// asserting the realized k, so a future value of the wrong KIND fails a test
// rather than the chain.
// RATIFIED POLICY COEFFICIENT, not a reproduced measurement. Say so plainly here,
// because the previous comment implied this number came out of a campaign.
//
// The first assembled schema-4 corpus now exists:
// doc/evidence/epoch-a-asert-schema4-cuda-2026-08-04. Measured on the CUDA
// launch cohort at this freeze it derives 4'007'014'530 -- parent 331'891'937
// attempts/s over 5 samples, RC 12.073250614 s over 8 episodes, bound to exact
// binaries and revision. The value installed here is 1.730x that envelope.
//
// It is installed deliberately high because the error is asymmetric: too low
// risks slow or stalled blocks at the fork, too high yields temporarily fast
// blocks that ASERT corrects within an epoch. Two further reasons not to lower
// it to the measured figure:
//
//  - the historical campaign behind this constant measured ~215.36M attempts/s
//    and ~32.18 s per RC episode on a different device class, and this cohort's
//    own RC timing has appeared in two clusters (~12 s and ~32 s) across builds
//    on the same GPU with no resolved explanation. The installed value lies
//    between the coefficients those clusters imply;
//  - this exact constant is NOT reproducible from the retained historical
//    artifacts, which yield 6'898'853'852, and those artifacts are classified
//    historical and non-authorizing.
//
// So: the corpus establishes a measured lower bound and binds it to real
// evidence; this separate ratified coefficient deliberately sits above it.
// Recalibrate if the representative launch cohort changes.
